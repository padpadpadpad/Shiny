### Sharpe-Schoolfield Shiny App

This is a Shiny app to help visualise what the modified Sharpe-Schoolfield models represent.

The app plots the high inactivation only model and the full model and allows for the user to change the parameters to see what they do and how they change each curve.

Download each file and open them in Rstudio and it should allow the app to be run.
